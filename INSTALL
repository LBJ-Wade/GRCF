Installation instructions for GRCF package.


-=REQUIREMENTS=-

GRCF requires some additional packages installed on your system. In this section we
provide the complete list of dependencies. As an example we show how to install these
packages on a deb-based operating system (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) with Apt
package manager. On other operating systems these packages can be installed in
the same way, using corresponding package manager (Yum, Yast, Pacman, etc.), but 
particular names of following packages can be somewhat different.

1) C++ compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/)

   sudo apt-get install g++

2) GSL (GNU Scientific Library) development files (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

   sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

3) Numpy python library (http://www.numpy.org/)

   sudo apt-get install python-numpy

4) Python scientific library (http://scipy.org/)

   sudo apt-get install python-scipy

5) Matplotlib python library (http://matplotlib.org)

   sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

6) Python high-level widgets library (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/)

   sudo apt-get install python-pmw

7) ImakeTk module for Python Image Library (PIL) (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

   sudo apt-get install python-pil.imagetk


-=INSTALLATION=-

Installation of the package requires two main steps.

1) Download the package from the github repository either by 'git clone' command

   git clone http://github.com/latrop/GRCF

or as a zip-archive directly from web-page of the project on the github site (http://github.com/latrop/GRCF).

2) Run make in the GRCFlibs sub-directory:

   cd %directory where GRCF is located%
   cd GRCFlibs/
   make

Now you can run GRCF package from the command line:

    ./GRCF.py

Note, that this will work only if your terminal is currently in the main package directory
(directory that contains GRCF.py file). If you want to run the program from an arbitrary
directory, you can add alias to your .bashrc file. For example, if you add this line

    alias GRCF='%full_path_to_file%GRCF.py'

in your .bashrc file, you will able to run GRCF package from any location using 'GRCF' command.
Note also, that some operating systems allow to run this package directly by double-clicking on
GRCF.py file.
